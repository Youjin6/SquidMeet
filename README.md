# SquidMeet

Squid Meet is a site that suggests locations in Washington for meetups. These locations include attractions, food/drink hotspots, and custom locations entered by users. Users must create an account to utilize its services. After creating an account, users will be able to browse images of locations that they would like to meet up with other users at. These locations can be filtered through various means, such as by location type or overall star rating. Then, they can view the address, hours of operation, and further details by clicking on the image thumbnail. If the location meets their criteria, they can schedule a meeting by sending an invitation to other users, who can accept or deny the invitation. Users who initiate these invitations act as event hosts and they may view the status of the invitees. All users will have a personal profile where they can edit basic information and view their upcoming events or pending invitations. Squid Meet also provides a ranking system for locations and a comment section for each location. Local reoccurring events are also listed in the locations.
